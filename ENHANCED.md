# Enhanced renderer — design

The faithful engine (see `ENGINE.md`) runs unchanged: simulation, game flow, the original 3D renderer,
cockpit and HUD, all at the game's own pace (about 6.3 frames a second in a race, `--frame-ticks 23`).
`src/enhanced/` records what every game frame built and draws the 3D view and the rear-view mirror again on
the host, for every displayed frame, and lays the result over the VGA screen.

Stage 1 (this version): **smooth motion at the display's rate** and **smooth, high-resolution graphics** from
the original data only. The draw distance is extended to 7 map cells around the camera (see Draw distance);
within the game's own 3, 6 or 10 cells what the game builds is what is drawn.

Files: `enhanced.c` (hooks, snapshots, the overlay record, the smooth view state, composition),
`enh_scene.c` (projection, faces, sprites, mirror, sky and ground as draw lists), `enh_raster.c` (draw lists
into sample buffers), `enh_sprite.c` (native sprite images and sizes), `enh_far.c` (the far ring),
`enh_internal.h`.

## Hooks

`run_stage`-style loops call the original frame (`frame_update`, `frame_draw`, HUD, `view_present`) as
before. Hooks, marked `ENH:` in the engine:

| Hook | Where | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `enh_init()` | `main.c` | options (not active with `--classic`) |
| `enh_sprites_loaded()` | `stage_load_objects` after `sprites_prescale` | native sprite images from DS:2500 (overwritten by the vertex arrays during the race) and the sizes of the original's pre-scaled copies |
| `enh_ov_begin()` / `enh_ov_pixels()` / `enh_ov_skip()` / `enh_ov_quad()` / `enh_ov_line()` | `frame_draw`, `cockpit_overlays`, `headlight_beam_draw`, `overlay_quads4_draw`, `wipers_update_draw` | the cockpit overlays in drawing order (see Overlays) |
| `enh_frame_drawn()` | end of `frame_draw` | the frame becomes the newest snapshot |
| `enh_view_presented()` | end of `view_present` | where V and the mirror image M are on the screen, and their contents |
| `enh_stop()` | `race_run` leaving and before the water-crash roll (which scrolls the screen), `main_menu` leaving the preview | stop laying the view over the screen (until the next frame is presented) |
| `enh_compose()` | `platform/vga.c` compose | draw and lay the enhanced view over the scaled VGA picture |

The main menu's rotating car uses the same frame, so it is enhanced too.

## Snapshots

`enh_frame_drawn` copies, from `mem[]`: the camera (`cam_x4`, `cam_z4`, `cam_heading`, `cam_y`, `cam_row`,
`pitch`, the roll code), the view window (`BA95`, `BA99`, `BA91`, mirror base `BD3D`, mirror on), the sky and
ground pairs and whether the gradient sky is on, all vertices (`vert_x/y/z`, world coordinates) and face records
(the far face buffer in list order), the objects (position, heading, flags, vertex ranges; moving vehicles are
those whose range lies after `parked_vert_end`), the sprite list (`spr_inst` entries with their instances'
positions and ids), the overlay record and V itself. The time of a snapshot is the due time of the timer tick
the frame started on (`host_tick_ns`), so snapshots are exact multiples of a tick apart.

Two consecutive snapshots form a continuous step unless the kind of view, the window or the layout changed, or
the camera jumped (more than 1.5 cells, 45° or 200h in height): restarts, replay start, the crash reset. A step
that is not continuous is shown without interpolation.

## Smooth motion

The game moves everything once per frame (every 23 ticks = 158 ms by default). The displayed frame at time
`t` uses `x = (t − t_n) / P`, the time since the newest snapshot `n` in game frames (`P` = the time between
snapshots `n−1` and `n`, or the configured pacing after a long gap), limited to 1.5 (a frame that is a tick
or two late keeps moving; a game that stops — message boxes, pause, the crash sequence — holds).

* **Camera.** `traj_n(t) = S_n + (x − L) · (S_n − S_{n−1})` with `L = --motion-delay / 100` (default 1):
  the view runs `L` of a frame behind the game and extrapolates the rest. The default interpolates only: the
  game turns in lumps (its heading changes by 0, 64, 128 or 192 units a frame, a short steering tap is a single
  lump), and any extrapolation overshoots each lump and pulls back, a wobble on every small correction (measured
  over twelve steering taps: 23 heading reversals at `L` = 0.5 against the game's own 12 at `L` = 1). Each component (x, z, heading with
  16-bit wrap, height, row = pitch + horizon, car pitch for the mirror, the roll slopes) is blended from the
  previous trajectory `traj_{n−1}(t)` to `traj_n(t)` with `smoothstep(x)` over the frame, so neither position
  nor speed jumps when a new game frame arrives (C1-continuous). Measured over 8 s of driving and steering: the
  largest frame-to-frame change of speed went from 450 to 38 units/s, of heading rate from 21600 to 1900 (plain
  extrapolation → blended).
  The height is kept at or above the line through the last two snapshots and is never guessed downwards past
  the newest: early in a frame the blend still follows the old trajectory, which keeps falling after a landing
  and keeps level where the road turns up a steep slope, and a late frame extrapolates a fall; either put the
  eye under the ground for a moment (the triangle around the camera then filled upwards, the map seen from
  below). Moving vehicles are likewise not guessed downwards. And the eye is kept `ENH_EYE_CLEAR` (20 units)
  over the game's ground under it (`enh_ground_height`: the highest triangle or quad containing the eye, seen
  from above, no steeper than 1.5, not more than 84 over the eye, so not a bridge deck): on a steep slope the
  game's own eye sinks to the surface and a frame or two below it (measured on a 21-degree slope: 6 units above,
  then 6 below, about 46 on the flat, while driving onto it the ground rose 15 under an eye held level), and the
  view showed the underside of the slope.
* **Moving vehicles** (traffic, police, opponents, the player's car in the external views) are carried with
  `traj_n` too, and turned to their exact interpolated heading: the original builds a model at the high byte
  of its heading (1.4° steps); here the difference to the full 16-bit heading is added around the object's
  position.
* **Sprites** that move (drifting clouds, birds, crash debris, the sun and moon, which follow the camera)
  likewise, matched by instance. Only those: the other sprites never move, and the tiles' children (the
  instances from `sprite_count` on: trees and roadside sprites) are handed out again in a new order whenever the
  world is rebuilt (`last_cell` / `last_octab` changed), so a slot can hold another tree of the same kind a cell
  away, which would be carried from there.
* **Pitch.** The horizon row and the mirror's car pitch also go through a 60 ms low-pass: the game's pitch bobs
  by up to 20 rows between frames over bumps and while steering.
* **Roll** is the original's shift code (`row offset = ±(x − centre) >> |code|`); the slope `2^−|code|` is
  interpolated.
* Everything else (the static world, lamps, colours, blinking pairs, weather) is shown as the newest snapshot
  has it.

`--motion-delay 100` never extrapolates (interpolation only, one game frame behind); `0` shows the newest frame
at once and guesses ahead.

## Projection

The original's projection is angular (cylindrical), not perspective (render3d.md §4.5): x is linear in the
bearing, y in the elevation, 256 px = 45°, and there is no near plane. `enh_scene.c` evaluates it in double
precision for the smooth camera:

* `sx = atan2(dx, dz) · 65536/2π + (BA99 << 8) − heading` (1/32 px, wrapping at 65536), with
  `dx = vx − cam_x4`, `dz = vz − cam_z4` (16-bit wrap);
* `dist = hypot(dx, dz)`, depth key `|vy − cam_y| + dist`;
* front row `cam_row − atan2(vy − cam_y, dist) · 1024/π + roll_slope · (sx − BA97)`;
* mirror row `(−elevation − mroll · (sx − 9400h) − pitch) / 2 + 10`, mirror x `(1600h − (sx − BD3D)) / 2`.

The original floors its bearings and elevations to whole pixels (the atan tables): at the display rate that
would make everything step; here they stay continuous.

## Faces

The face list of the newest snapshot, drawn farthest first in the game's own sorted order (`361c`, captured
from the order array): re-sorting at every displayed frame made coplanar faces (road markings on the road,
decals) swap as their keys crossed during the smooth motion, a visible shimmer. Depth keys by the original's rule
(nearest vertex, average, `s·11/32` for triangles, farthest-vertex flag) are evaluated in floating point for the
view time (for the haze, and for sprites against points and lines, see Sprites). Per face, as `3a7c`:

* the front-view test (all x negative / all ≥ 2800h / none below 5400h, as 16-bit results) and otherwise the
  mirror test against `BD3D`; a face is drawn in at most one view;
* triangles and quads whose bearings leave a gap of more than half a turn are ordinary polygons (their x
  values unwrapped around the view); otherwise the camera is inside: quads are split, and a triangle around the
  camera fills below each edge (above, when its plane is higher than the camera) across the arc of bearings the
  edge covers (`3ebf`), which is how the ground under the car is drawn;
* face type 0 ORs its colours into what is below (headlight beams), hidden by day when its pair is 0707h; pair
  010Fh blinks with the frame counter;
* lines: one pixel wide, or (width flags) the angular half width `atan(size / dist)` of the near end, plus a
  pixel as the original widens; at least one row high;
* points (lamps, and the wheels of the cars): the original's lens-shaped blob — row `k` of `2r` widened by
  `inc · k · (2r − 1 − k) / 2`, width from how squarely the lamp faces the camera, owner object by vertex range —
  as a polygon. The original truncates the radius `atan(size / dist)` to whole pixels (nothing below 1); the
  continuous radius is taken half a pixel smaller, the original's average, so small blobs (far wheels) keep
  their size relative to their car.

The ground-slope, surface, crash and bump tests of the face drawer stay in the original renderer: the enhanced
one only draws.

`ENH:` no far LOD. Vehicles and some buildings (barn, hangar, houses) have a far model with fewer faces that
`539d` / `52a3` use more than 200h (Manhattan, from the car) away; with the enhanced view on, the game always
builds the near model (`far_lod` in `render_object.c`), since at the enhanced resolution the missing detail
shows and the cost does not matter. `--classic` keeps the original's switch. The detail level's own choices
(cells, trees, sprite range, F2) are unchanged.

## Sprites

Each sprite is drawn from its native image (decoded from the sprite set at stage load, rows centred as
`sprite_scale_row` pads them). Its size follows the apparent size `a = atan(size / key)` (8-pixel units)
continuously: at every whole `a` it is exactly the size of the copy the original would pick (`BA0E` step →
cached copy W × H), linear in between; fixed-size sprites (kind 1) keep their 1:1 copy. Placement as `2b74` /
`2999`: centred on the bearing, bottom on the elevation of its distance (clamped by `95CD`), the roll term;
the mirror's half size (key × 2), its x and its rows. The visibility window (`hi(angle) + 8`), the key limits
(`B6E2`, 980h, 10h) and the classes are the original's.

`ENH:` **where a sprite goes among the faces.** `323e` merges the sprites into the sorted faces by depth key (a
sprite before a face when its key is larger). Here the faces keep the game's order while the keys are the
smooth camera's, so along that order they are not monotonic, and a small move of the camera put a sprite before
the face it lies or stands on: the road markings (sprites 1 and 3, 6 × 2 white-and-yellow dashes lying on the
road) and trees at the foot of slopes were drawn over, on and off. Measured while driving: 14..17 sprites a
displayed frame drawn under a face that could not hide them, one of them switching every 2..3 displayed frames.
Placing each sprite somewhere in the faces' order (after the faces that cannot hide it, before those in
front of it) was tried and is not enough: no single place is right for a sprite that a car or a slope hides
only in part, and the game's order itself is not exact (a large ground face a tree stands on can come after a
hill in front of the tree), so trees still showed over cars and slopes.

Instead the sprites are tested per sample. Every face, drawn in the game's order as before, leaves in the
target's depth buffer the distance from the camera along each sample's line of sight: a polygon its plane
(`Z_PLANE`: the line of sight of the sample, the inverse of the projection, `EnhMap` / `target_rays` in
`enh_raster.c`, met with the plane `n · X = d`; checked: at every face's first corner it gives that corner's
distance, to float precision), a lamp or a line the distance of its nearest end. The sky clears it; the OR
faces (headlight beams) and the cockpit overlays leave it. Then the sprites are drawn farthest first, each
sample only where the sprite's distance (to its base) less `SPR_ON_FACE` (64 units, so that what stands or
lies on a surface, a tree on a slope, a road marking, is not hidden by it) is below the depth there. So a
sprite is hidden exactly where something nearer covers it: partly behind a car, behind the crest of a hill,
and the markings stay on the road. The sun and the moon are drawn first, behind everything. Measured at the
default 1280 × 800, 2 × 2: 3.4 ms a frame (median), about as before.

`ENH:` **the sun and the moon** (instance 8, sprites 5 and 4) are a solid disc (14 × 11, round with the VGA's
tall pixels) and a crescent (8 × 11); scaled up they were blocky blobs. They are drawn as smooth shapes in the
same rectangle and colour (`P_ELLIPSE`): the sun the inscribed ellipse, the moon a circle 11 image pixels across
at the image's left edge less a 10 × 11 ellipse centred 10 pixels right of it (fitted to the image: 4 of its 88
pixels differ).

## Sky and ground

The horizon is the camera row with the roll slope. The sky: the flat colour, and when the original draws its
gradient (detail ≥ 1, VGA, no flash), the five four-row bands above the horizon blended into a continuous
gradient that follows the horizon, also when rolled (the original drops the gradient when the car rolls). The
ground: the ground pair below the horizon. The mirror's sky and ground come from `7b9b`'s horizon (the car's
pitch and roll, its halved rows included).

## Distance fog

`ENH:` first after Play Stunts' distance colouring (a browser reconstruction of Stunts, whose engine TD3 shares);
now a per-sample fog. What is far away takes on the colour of the sky at the horizon (the gradient's lowest
band, or the flat sky pair), resolved through the current DAC, so the fog follows the time of day, the weather,
fades and flashes by itself. The amount is `--haze` (default 70 %) at the edge of the far ring
(`--draw-distance` × 1000h, so that the edge fades out), or without it `ENH_HAZE_FAR` (3000h), rising from
`--fog-start` (default 10 % of that distance) as exponential-squared fog does: `(1 − e^(−2.5 x²)) / (1 − e^(−2.5))` of it, `x` the
share of the way. Little near the car, then the scenery sinks into it gradually:

* polygons per sample, by the distance along the sample's line of sight to the face's plane (the same distance
  the depth buffer holds, see Sprites), through a 1024-entry table (`enh_fog_lut`). A large face, a long road
  or a hillside, fades along its length; hazed by face (the average depth of its corners, as before) a face
  took one amount all over and the fog changed in steps from face to face;
* lamps and lines (no plane) by the average depth of their corners; not the OR faces (headlight beams), nor
  the lamps at night;
* sprites by their key; not those above the eye (the sun, the moon, clouds, birds);
* the ground by its angle below the horizon, as seen from `ENH_HAZE_EYE` (50 units) over flat ground.

The fog is the top byte of the sample (see Rasterising). Not in the main menu's preview, nor on the mirror's
ground.

## Headlight beams

`ENH:` the OR faces (headlight beams, the game's and the cockpit overlay's) are lights: instead of ORing their
bits into the colours, they mark the samples they cover as lit in the target's light buffer (`lt`, per sample:
amount | bits << 8). A beam is several polygons side by side, so the soft edge is made from their union, not per
polygon (which left dark seams where they meet): after the draw list, the amounts are box-filtered over
`--beam-soft` (3) view pixels each way, rows then columns, and eased with smoothstep, so the rim fades over
6 view pixels, half inside the beam and half outside. What is drawn over the lights afterwards (the dashboard)
is marked blocked: it keeps the amount below it for the filter (the beam does not fade along the dashboard)
but is not lit. The composition blends the colours with the bits ORed in by the amount, then the fog.
By day the game draws the beams only in rain or snow (from the first weather-zone tile until the zone's level
is back to 0, so they stay on for a while after the weather clears); the day palette's colours with 08h ORed
in are far brighter than the night's, so a beam's full amount is `--beam-day` (default 35 %) by day and
`--beam-night` (100 %) at night; the soft rim is `--beam-soft` view pixels each side (default 3, 0 = hard). `--enh-lights 0`
(the launcher's Enhanced lights off) gives the original's beams: full strength by day and night, a hard edge.

## Draw distance

The game builds the 3, 6 or 10 map cells nearest the camera (`world_build_visible`, a table per heading
octant), lists the leg's own sprites (trees, rocks, animals) only within a cell of the car, and draws sprites
only up to C00h / 1100h / 1C00h (`B6E2`, by detail): scenery appears a few hundred metres ahead. Its buffers
hold 1600 vertices and faces, its physics reads the ground from the renderer, so it is not asked for more.

`ENH:` the enhanced view builds the rest itself (`enh_far.c`), for every game frame, read-only: every map cell
whose centre is within `--draw-distance` cells of the camera (default 7) and which lies wholly within 7.5 cells
of it on each axis (vertex coordinates are 16-bit, x4 units: they wrap 8 cells from the camera, and a wrapped
vertex made a face across the sky; a model with a vertex beyond `FAR_REACH` is dropped whole) that the
game did not build (`enh_world_begin` / `enh_world_cell` record its cells in `world_build_visible`), from the
same tile and object models as `model_place`: the vertices rotated as `vertex_rotate`, the faces coloured as
`model_emit_faces`, the cell's static objects as `world_build_visible` selects them, the tiles' sprite children
thinned by the vegetation seed exactly as the game does (so a cell looks the same when the game takes it over),
and the leg's own sprites beyond the game's list, with their live ids. The faces are sorted farthest first by
the original's key at the snapshot's camera (per game frame, so coplanar faces do not swap between displayed
frames). Parked objects (houses, boats: flags 1000h without 2000h), which the game draws only within its window
around the car (`509b`, `B6E0`: they appeared a cell and a half away), are added from their near model where
the game did not emit them this frame; not the lightning bolt (flags 1Fxxh, object model 21, a white mast 1344
units high that `509b` shows only in a storm, at random, with a sky flash: drawn always, it stood as white spikes
over the night legs). A face of the ring that surrounds the camera is not drawn: the view runs
up to a game frame behind, so just after the game moves into a new cell the view can still be in the old one,
which the ring then holds; filled around the camera, its ground covered the sky (green flashes) and, as depth,
hid nearby cars and scenery. They are drawn before the game's faces and leave their depth in a second, far buffer; the game's faces
are then drawn only where they are nearer than it (with 1 % allowance), since a cell the game skipped at the
side can be nearer than one it built ahead. Sprites reach as far as the ring (their size below the game's
smallest copy in proportion to the angle) and are tested against both. The ring's lamps are not drawn (a lamp
needs its owner object). Measured: at most about 4500 faces and 700 sprites in the ring; 4.2 ms a frame at the
default 1280 × 800, 2 × 2 against 3.3 ms without it. `--draw-distance 0` draws the game's cells only.

## Overlays

The cockpit overlays are drawn into V after the 3D (`cockpit_overlays`, `mirror_frame_draw`). They are recorded
in drawing order:

* pixel sections — rain streaks, snow flakes, windscreen drops, the mirror's lower rim: the pixels V changed
  since the last mark, drawn as blocks of the original pixel size;
* polygon sections — headlight beams (OR mode), the dashboard edge and the wipers (four quads and two edge
  lines): recorded with their vertices (`scr_x/scr_y` slots 630h..63Fh) and fake face records, drawn again at
  the output resolution.

They are replayed over the enhanced 3D view in the same order.

## Rasterising

A draw list per target (the front view, the mirror) of polygons (sample coordinates, up to 16 points), sprites
(destination rectangle, native image), overlay blocks and the sky. A target has `K = res_scale × aa` samples
per original pixel along each axis; it is drawn in bands of 16 sample rows on the host's worker threads (every
band walks the whole list: painter's algorithm), with exact coverage at sample centres (no widening: shared
edges tile exactly).

A sample holds a colour pair and the weight of its high colour. The original's faces are two-colour checkerboard
dithers; from afar a dither is its average, so a sample of a pair resolves to the average of the two DAC
colours (weight 128), the sky gradient uses the weight for its blend, sprites and overlay pixels are solid.
The top byte is the distance haze (0..255, the share of the horizon's sky colour). Beside it every sample has a
depth (float, the distance along its line of sight to what was drawn there), used only to test the sprites
(see Sprites). Resolving averages
`aa × aa` samples per output pixel through the current DAC (fades and flashes included).

## Game speed

The game moves every car a fixed distance per frame: nothing in the simulation depends on time (only the
steering yaw uses the measured frame length `B70E`), and the race clock advances one second every 5 frames, its
design rate. So how fast the world passes is purely the frame rate, `--frame-ticks`. Measured at the faithful
port's 23 ticks (6.3 frames a second): at a speedometer reading of 96 the car moves 193 world units a frame; the
cars are about 460 units long and 144 wide (1–1.4 cm a unit), so the scenery passes at 13–17 m/s, 30–40 mph —
about a third of the speedometer (the game's own odometer claims 16 m a frame, six times the geometry). The
original's 6-frame jumps of 2–3 m made that feel fast; drawn smoothly at the display rate it looks slow.

`ENH:` the default is **14 ticks** (10.4 frames a second, 1.6 times faster than the faithful port; chosen by
play-testing). At 10 ticks (14.6 frames a second, 2.3 times faster) the scenery passes at about the
speedometer's speed and 0–100 takes about 6 s instead of 10, and the race clock counts real time instead of
frames (`race_clock_hud`, `hud_topbar.c`): timer ticks of each frame, at most two frames' worth (a message box or
pause does not advance it, as the original's frame count stops then), a second per 145.652 ticks; `clock_frames`
and `clock_sub` keep their meaning (fifths of the second, and the digit made from them). Race times, the
opponents' times and penalties are therefore in real seconds at any game speed. Everything else the game counts
in frames (traffic, police, opponents, the lights, the wipers) runs faster together with the cars, as it did on
fast PCs (the original program's own limit is 5 ticks).

## Controls

`race_run` reads the controls three times a frame (`race_input` 0, 1, 2), all after the simulation step, so
the car reacted to keys held up to a whole frame (158 ms) earlier. `ENH:` the first read now runs just before
`frame_update`: still three reads a frame (steering and throttle change at the same rate per frame), the newest
one right before the physics. Measured: the steering wheel moves in the first frame after the key instead of the
second. (The game's own steering still builds up over about three frames.)

## Steering

The original's keyboard steering stepped the wheel (0..20h) by 1..3 per control read and the car turned by
those steps, rounded further on the way (the course to 1/64 of a turn, the camera heading to 64 units, a
doubled turn on the last wheel step only, centring 6 then 0 on alternate frames). Its jitter hid that; in the
smooth view every step showed. `ENH:` rewritten for a smooth turn from a nudge to a hard turn, as in TD2
Enhanced:

* **Wheel** (`steer_frame`, `sim_controls.c`, once per game frame): a continuous position `steer_pos`
  (-1..1). A key swings it towards its lock at a rate falling with speed (centre to lock 0.28 s standing,
  0.9 s at car speed 60h and above), easing in from 45 % over the first 0.25 s, so a tap gives a small angle;
  turning back through the centre goes 2.5 times as fast. Without a key (both keys, or wheel centring on and
  the car moving) it returns to the centre with a 0.15 s time constant. `DS_steer_wheel` follows it for the
  HUD. The mouse and the analog stick set the wheel themselves, as before.
* **Turn** (`sim_physics.c`, step 18): the original's formula in fractions, with the response curve
  `p (1 + |p|^3)` (linear near the centre, the original's doubled turn at full lock), in proportion to the
  frame's length, followed by the turn rate with a 0.1 s time constant; the heading keeps its fraction
  (`sim_fine_heading`), which the smooth view uses instead of the rounded camera heading.
* **Kept:** the handbrake (Space multiplies the turn by the car's `123Ah / 123Ch`), crosswind, the pull of
  a damaged car, the slow-speed fade, the sensitivity setting (F3), and the grip / slide limits that make the
  car spin and slide. The car moves along its whole course (`sim_physics.c`, step 6).

## Finish marker

`ENH:` `compass_draw` (`hud_topbar.c`) also marks the direction of the leg's finish (`--finish-marker`, default
on): the finish is the one cell whose tile has a face of type 1Fh (the gas station; found by scanning the leg
map's tile models, remembered while that cell still holds it), its centre's bearing from the car relative to the
heading at the compass's 128 px a turn. Inside the window (x 8..31) a light green triangle at the bottom, under
the letter of that direction; outside it an arrow at the window's left or right edge. The window is redrawn
when the mark moves. The compass letters are the game's per leg (`leg_compass_offset`: they read N while
leg A of SCENE01 heads east); the mark follows the map.

## Police

`police_update` (`sim_traffic.c`) starts a chase for any police car whose nearest vertex is within about F80h
(depth key) of the camera while the car does 48 or more, in any direction: also one driving ahead the same
way, which then speeds off in front of the player at chase speed, and an oncoming one, which turns round in
front of the player and blocks the road with its siren on. `ENH:` a police car that is still ahead of the player
(in front of the line across the car, `police_ahead`), whichever way it faces or parked, does not start a
chase; once the player has passed it, it does (the oncoming one then turning round, as the original). Likewise a
chasing police car tickets an opponent (same direction, within D8h) only once the opponent has overtaken it
(object headings are the view's less 4000h). The radar detector and the pull-over are as before.

## Composition

`platform/vga.c` scales the 320 × 200 VGA picture by `--res-scale` and calls `enh_compose`, which lays the
enhanced view over the view window and the mirror. An original pixel of the view window shows the enhanced view
when the screen still holds what `view_present` copied there (so message boxes, the replay panel, the crash
cracks and the water roll, drawn over the screen or into V later, stay), V was not changed after the frame
(the cracks) — both compared as they were at that `view_present`, since the game draws its next frame before
presenting it and the host presents in between — it is not in the mirror's hole (V rows 0..13 at x 168..255) or under a message box
(`msg_protect`). A mirror pixel shows the enhanced mirror when it is in the part `mirror_present` copies, not
the frame `mirror_frame_draw` paints, the mirror is on and valid, and the screen still holds it.

While the enhanced view is shown the frame source reports a change on every call, so the host presents at
the display rate (VSync).

## Options

| Option | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `--res-scale N` | 4 | picture 320 × 200 times N (1..8) |
| `--aa N` | 2 | N × N samples per output pixel (1 = off; res scale × aa is kept ≤ 16) |
| `--motion-delay P` | 100 | percent of a game frame the smooth view runs behind the game (below 100 it guesses ahead) |
| `--haze P` | 30 | distance haze: percent of the horizon's sky colour on what is farthest (0 = off) |
| `--draw-distance N` | 7 | map cells drawn around the camera (0..7; 0 = the game's own cells) |
| `--classic` | | the original's picture only (at `--res-scale`, default 1) |

## Developer aids

* `TD3_ENH_COMPARE=1` (`2`): the newest game frame without smoothing, enhanced on the left (right) half of the
  screen and the original on the other half.
* `TD3_ENH_LOG=file`: one line per displayed frame: time, game frame, camera, primitives, render time in µs,
  speed, held direction bits, brake, throttle, steering wheel.
* `TD3_KBD_LOG=file` (`host.c`): every XT byte fed to the game's keyboard handler, with its time.
* `TD3_ENH_BLEND=frames`: how long a new frame's motion takes to take over (default 1).
* `TD3_START_LEG=n` (`flow.c`): the race starts at leg n (0-based), to reach a later leg's scenery quickly.
* `TD3_DEBUG_KEYS=1` (`race_run`): turns on the original's dormant debug keys, Shift+T rain, Shift+S snow,
  Shift+N night (they also make the car invulnerable), to check the renderer in weather.
* The port's `TD3_SNAPSHOT_DIR` / `TD3_KEYS` work as before; snapshots are saved at the output resolution.

## Later

Traffic beyond the game's range, lamps in the far ring, widescreen, the original's dither as an
option, weather effects animated at the display rate, the menu preview's own pacing.

## Key bindings

`ENH:` after Aces of the Pacific Enhanced (`enh_keys.c`). `--keys name=code,...` gives actions other keys (XT
make codes, 100h = sent after E0h, 1000h / 2000h / 4000h = Shift / Ctrl / Alt held with it; 0 = no key); the
launcher's Game settings > Key Bindings writes it. `host.c` passes every key through `enh_key_map`: while a race runs
(`race_run`, not in a message box, whose answers are Y / N, digits and Enter), a key bound to an action is sent
as the action's own key, with the modifiers that key needs pressed or let go around it; the default key of an
action bound elsewhere is dropped; other keys go through. A key keeps what it sent until it goes up, so a
binding never sticks when the race ends with it held; the focus loss forgets every key.
