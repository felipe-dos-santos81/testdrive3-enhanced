# Test Drive III Enhanced — SDL3

An enhanced native port of Accolade's *Test Drive III: The Passion* (1990). Not an emulator. The original game
files are not included.

## Features

* Smooth 3D view at your display's refresh rate.
* High resolution (up to 2560 × 1600) with anti-aliasing.
* Longer draw distance and gradual distance fog.
* Smooth steering; spins, slides and the handbrake as in the original.
* Truer game speed; the race clock counts real seconds.
* Finish marker on the compass.
* Fixes to police, landings and other original quirks (see `CHANGELOG.md`).
* A launcher for car, course, skill and picture options.

## How to play (Windows)

1. Put your original game files in a folder named `Game`.
2. Place the program files next to it:

   ```text
   Test Drive III Enhanced\
   ├── Game\                           <- your game files (TDIII.EXE, DATAA.DAT, PLAYDISK.DAT, ...)
   ├── Test Drive III Enhanced.exe     <- the launcher
   ├── testdrive3-enhanced.exe         <- the game
   └── SDL3.dll and the other DLLs
   ```

3. Run `Test Drive III Enhanced.exe`, pick your options and press **Play**.

* The folder must be writable (high scores and choices are saved in `Game`).
* Alt+Enter: full screen.
* Launcher settings: `%APPDATA%\Test Drive III Enhanced\settings.ini`.

## Requirements

* Game files: `TDIII.EXE` (or `TD3.EXE`), `PLAYDISK.DAT`, `DATAA–C.DAT`, `INSTR.DAT`, the car (`C*`) and scene (`SCENE*`) files.
* A multi-core CPU for the default picture; lower the resolution or anti-aliasing on slow machines.
* To build: CMake 3.24+, C11, SDL 3; the launcher needs C++17 and wxWidgets 3.2.

## Build

In Git Bash or an MSYS2 MinGW64 shell:

```bash
export PATH="/c/msys64/mingw64/bin:$PATH"
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
```

* `-DTD3E_LAUNCHER=OFF` builds the game only.
* The MSYS2 `SDL3.dll` also needs `libiconv-2.dll` from `C:\msys64\mingw64\bin`.

## Run

```bash
./build/testdrive3-enhanced.exe --game-dir Game
```
