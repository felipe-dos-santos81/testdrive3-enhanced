/* Enhanced renderer (ENHANCED.md). Not bound by the faithful-engine rules in ENGINE.md.
 *
 * The faithful engine keeps running every frame at its own pace (frame_update / frame_draw / view_present,
 * ~6.3 frames a second in a race). This module records what each of those frames built (camera, world
 * vertices and faces, sprites, the cockpit overlays), draws the 3D view and the rear-view mirror again on
 * the host at a higher resolution with anti-aliasing, for every displayed frame, with the camera and the
 * moving objects carried smoothly between the game's frames, and lays the result over the VGA screen.
 * The hooks below are called from the engine at the places marked `ENH:`. */
